  "description": "Buggregator is a free, multi-purpose server tool designed primarily for debugging PHP applications, but it's also compatible with other programming languages. Think of it as a Swiss Army knife for developers. What makes it special is that it offers a range of features that you would usually find in various paid tools, but it's available for free."
